# C Programming Assignments

#Assignment 1

###Part 1

```
Write a C program which uses a function called search to find
the location of a value in THREE arrays of floats. The function should
take three parameters :
         the value to be found
         the array to be searched
         the size of the array

N.B.!!!! The main program should read in three arrays of varying size
         example : array a has twelve elements
                   array b has six elements
                   array c has nine elements
                   array d has four elements
         input to these arrays terminated by illegal input(see handout)

         The function should return for each array the index where the
         value is found. If not found the function should return -1.
```

###Part 2
